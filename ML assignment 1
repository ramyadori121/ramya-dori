Question:

A farmer has recently acquired a 110 hectares piece of land. He has decided to grow Wheat and barley on that land. Due to the quality of the sun and the region’s excellent climate, the entire production of Wheat and Barley can be sold. He wants to know how to plant each variety in the 110 hectares, given the costs, net proﬁts and labor requirements according to the data shown below:
Crop      Cost (Rs/Hec) Proﬁt (Price/Hec) Man-days/Hec
Wheat     7000           50                 10 
Barley     2000          120                30
The farmer has a budget of Rs. 7,00,000 and availability of 1,200 man-days during the planning horizon. Find the optimal solution and the optimal value.


Solution:

from scipy.optimize import linprog
obj=[-50,-120]
lhs=[[10,30],[7000,2000],[1,1]]
rhs=[[1200,700000,110]]
bnd=[(0,float("inf")),(0,float("inf"))]
opt=linprog(c=obj,A_ub=lhs,b_ub=rhs,bounds=bnd,method="Simplex")
opt

con: array([], dtype=float64)
     fun: -5778.9473684210525
 message: 'Optimization terminated successfully.'
     nit: 3
   slack: array([0.        , 0.        , 4.73684211])
  status: 0
 success: True
       x: array([97.89473684,  7.36842105])
       
       
conclusion:

To get maximum profit x(wheat) value should be in "98" hectares of land  and y(barley)value should be "7" hectares of land
